== INSTALL  ====================================================================

(1) Install VirtualBox _and_ VirtualBox Extension Pack:
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

(2) Install Vagrant:
    * Windows, Mac OS X: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
    * Ubuntu: apt-get install vagrant

(2.5) Under Windows, you may have to reboot...

(3) Make sure you are connected to the Internet, preferably via a fast
    connection. Run 'vagrant up && vagrant ssh' from inside this directory (NOT the "base" directory).

(4) You are now accessing the VM via ssh.
    To look around, run 'ls -l'. (Note the shared folder.)
    To exit, run 'exit'.

(5) To halt the VM, run 'vagrant halt'.
    To spin it back up, run 'vagrant up && vagrant ssh' again.
    To remove the VM, run 'vagrant destroy'.

(6) The folder ./shared on your host machine is accessible from the virtual
    machine at ~/shared. You can do all editing etc on your physical machine and
    use the virtual machine only for building & running your application.

(7) Refer to the README for more options and frequently asked questions.

(*) Tip: You may want to run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest` in the
    vagrant folder on your physical machine. This will ensure your
    "VirtualBox Guest Additons" are always up to date (outdated Guest Additions
    can sometimes cause problems).

(*) Tip: You can restart the virtual machine by running `vagrant reload`. This
    can sometimes fix problems (and will update your Guest Additions, provided
    you followed the tip above).
